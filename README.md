**model**: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.

**roomdb**: it contain room database classes to load offline data

**network**: It contains retrofit classes and repositories to connect the API.

**activity**: View classes along with their corresponding Presenters.

**utils**: Utility classes.


### Running App:
- The App code can run using and IDE that supports Android (Android Studio, VS-Code, Eclipse, ...etc).

### unit test and code coverage
- The app unit tests as well can run using any IDE.
- The app unit tests can be run separately like regular Kotlin class, no need to run the app itself.
- Each unit test class can run separately, and every function of the class can run separately.
- The test code coverage report can be generated along with the unit test execution using any IDE (e.g in Android Studio you can select "Run [class-name] with Coverage" instead of "Run [class-name]"), and using the same IDE you can have all the coverage reports accomolated for the whole app.
